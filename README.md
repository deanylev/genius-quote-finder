## Running

You must be using Node.js 14 or higher, as some newer ES syntax features are utilised. Run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn start` to start the server. `yarn lint` can be used to lint the JavaScript of both the backend and frontend. The server runs on port 8080 by default, but you can set the `PORT` environment variable to change this.
